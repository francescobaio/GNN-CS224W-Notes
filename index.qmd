Welcome to my **personal notes** on the Stanford Graph Neural Networks (GNN) Course.  
These notes capture my own takeaways, clarifications and code examples from each lecture. Since there are many lessons, I keep their detailed list in a separate note.

## Key Sections

- [Lessons_index](/GNN-CS224W-Notes/Lessons_index.html) – Complete list of all lessons, each with summaries and links.
- [Glossary](/GNN-CS224W-Notes/Glossary.html)  – Definitions of common GNN terms and acronyms.
- [References](/GNN-CS224W-Notes/References.html) – Links to papers, official resources and anything useful.
- `Code_Examples/` – Folder containing practical notebooks for hands-on GNN experiments.

## How to Use These Notes

- **Personal Perspective**: These are my own summaries of what I’ve learned; they may not be exhaustive.  
- **Full Lesson List**: If you want a detailed breakdown of each lecture, check out [Lessons_index](/GNN-CS224W-Notes/Lessons_index.html). 
- **Hands-On Practice**: You can explore the `Code_Examples` folder for GNN implementations and experiments. (coming soon...)
