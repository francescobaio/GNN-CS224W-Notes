## Discussion of Key Concepts

This lecture explores traditional, handcrafted approaches for link prediction, focusing on how to extract and utilize graph structural features to predict the presence of links between nodes. Key topics include:

- **Link Prediction Overview:**  
    The task is formulated as a binary classification problem where, given a pair of nodes, the goal is to predict whether a link exists. Handcrafted features derived from the graphâ€™s topology are used as predictors.
    
- **Local Similarity Metrics:**  
    Several metrics are introduced to assess the likelihood of a link:
    
    - **Common Neighbors:** counts the number of shared neighbors between two nodes.
        
    - **Jaccard Coefficient:** ratio of common neighbors on the union of their neighbors.
        
    - **Adamic/Adar Index:** weighs shared neighbors inversely by their overall connectivity.
        
- **Katz Index:**  
    Moves beyond immediate neighborhoods by summing over the total number of paths between node pairs. A damping factor exponentially penalizes longer paths, thus incorporating both local and global network information.
    
- **Adjacency Matrix Powers:**  
    The lecture explains that the k-th power of the adjacency matrix reveals the number of distinct paths of length k between nodes. 
    Under the proper conditions, the infinite series summing the weighted powers of the adjacency matrix can be expressed in a **closed form**. This provides an elegant mathematical formulation of link prediction that unifies local metrics (like common neighbors) with contributions from longer-range connections.

## My Personal Takeaways

	
1. **Capturing Global Structure:**  
    Techniques like the Katz Index and adjacency matrix powers allow for the consideration of paths of varying lengths, integrating both local and global information.
    
2. **Mathematical Elegance:**  
    The closed-form expression derived from the weighted sum of adjacency matrix powers offers a powerful and compact way to summarize connectivity, even if it is often computationally intensive for large graphs.
    
3. **Scalability Concerns:**  
    Traditional metrics can be computationally expensive on large graphs, emphasizing the importance of exploring scalable alternatives in modern graph learning.
