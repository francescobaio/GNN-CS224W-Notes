## Discussion of Key Concepts

- **Collective Classification**  
    The idea of assigning labels to **all** nodes in a network **together**, leveraging dependencies   among connected nodes rather than classifying each independently.
    
- **Homophily**  
    The tendency of similar nodes (e.g. with comparable attributes or interests) to connect to one another, forming cohesive clusters.
    
- **Guilt by Association**  
    If a node is connected predominantly to neighbors of a certain label, it is more likely to share that label “you are who you associate with.”
    
- **Label Dependencies**  
    The class label of a node v depends not only on its own features but also on the labels (and sometimes features) of its immediate neighbors.
    
- **Markov Assumption (First-Order)**  
    We assume that a node’s label is conditioned only on the labels of its **direct** neighbors, ignoring higher-order dependencies.
    
- **Local Classifier**  
    An initial classifier that assigns labels based **solely** on each node’s features, applied **once** at the start of the process.
    
- **Relational Classifier**  
    A classifier that captures correlations between connected nodes by using both a node’s features and the **labels** of its neighbors.
    
- **Collective Inference**  
    An **iterative** belief-propagation process:
    
    1. Apply the relational classifier to each node.
        
    2. Update node labels based on neighboring predictions.
        
    3. Repeat until labels stabilize or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

## My Personal Takeaways

1. **Balancing Local Features and Global Structure**  
    Collective classification integrates node-level attributes with graph topology, yielding more robust predictions than purely local methods.
    
2. **Iteration and Convergence**  
    Similar to power-iteration in PageRank, collective inference propagates beliefs iteratively. Convergence speed and stability depend on update order and stopping criteria.
    
3. **Wide Applicability**  
    From document classification to fraud detection, message passing and collective classification are essential wherever entity correlations carry meaningful signal.

## Next Steps

- **Explore Advanced Variants**  
    Investigate probabilistic message passing methods (e.g., belief propagation, probabilistic relational models) to better handle uncertainty in node labels.
