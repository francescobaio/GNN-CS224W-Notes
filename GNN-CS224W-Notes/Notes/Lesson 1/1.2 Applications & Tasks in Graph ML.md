## Key Topics

### Node-Level Tasks

- **Protein Structure & AlphaFold:**  
  - Modeling the three-dimensional organization of proteins as graphs.
  - **Spatial Graph Idea:**  
    - **Nodes:** Represent amino acids.  
    - **Edges:** Connect amino acids based on proximity.
  - Underpins methods like AlphaFold.

### Edge-Level Tasks

- **Edge Prediction & Recommender Systems:**  
  - Predicting the existence or strength of edges between nodes.
  - Learning embeddings so that related nodes are closer in the d-dimensional space than unrelated ones.
- **Bipartite Graphs in Image Analysis:**  
  - Combining image features with graph structure can outperform using image data alone.
- **Predicting Drug-Protein Impact:**  
  - Analyzing drug-protein interaction networks to forecast the impact of drug combinations and potential side effects.
  
### Subgraph-Level Tasks

- **Traffic Prediction:**  
  - Using subgraph-level ML tasks to forecast traffic patterns.
  - Deployed in production systems like Google Maps.
### Graph-Level Tasks

- **Drug Discovery & Molecule Generation:**  
  - Applying graph-level ML for drug discovery, including deep learning for antibiotic discovery.
  - **Graph Generation:**  
    - Generating molecules in a targeted way for novel drug design.

## My Personal Takeaways

1. **Task Diversity:**  
   Graph ML spans from node-level tasks (protein modeling) to graph-level tasks (drug discovery), showcasing its versatility.
2. **Representation Learning is Central:**  
   Learning embeddings that reflect similarity is key to tasks like edge prediction and recommender systems.
3. **Real-World Impact:**  
   Applications such as traffic prediction and drug-protein interaction analysis demonstrate how Graph ML can drive practical innovations.
