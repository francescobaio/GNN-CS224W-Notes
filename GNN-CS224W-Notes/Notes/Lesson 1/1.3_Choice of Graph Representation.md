## Key Topics

- **Building a Graph:**  
  - Deciding on the object of interest is crucial. In some cases, the choice is unambiguous, while in others, multiple valid options exist—making the decision particularly important.

- **Graph Types:**  
  - **Undirected vs. Directed:**  
    - Refer to the [Glossary](Glossary.html) for definitions on node degree and other related terms.
  - **Bipartite Graphs:**  
    - Graphs that consist of two distinct sets of nodes with edges only between sets.

- **Graph Representations:**  
  - **Adjacency Matrix:**  
    - A common method to represent graphs.
    - These matrices are typically sparse (e.g., in human social networks or email graphs).
  - **Adjacency List:**  
    - Often more efficient and easier to use for sparse graphs.

- **Nodes and Edges Properties:**  
  - Both nodes and edges can carry additional properties such as weight, ranking, type, sign, etc.

- **Multigraphs:**  
  - Graphs that allow more than one edge between the same pair of nodes.

- **Connectivity Concepts:**  
	  - **General Connectivity:**  
	    - A graph is considered connected if every node can be reached from every other node via a path; otherwise, there may be isolated nodes.
	    - In graphs with multiple components, the adjacency matrix often displays a block diagonal structure.
	  - **Directed Graph Connectivity:**  
		  - **Strong Connectivity:** A directed graph is strongly connected if, for every pair of nodes (u, v), there exists a directed path from u to v and from v to u.  
		  - **Weak Connectivity:** A directed graph is weakly connected if, when all edges are treated as undirected, the graph becomes connected—even though a directed path between every pair of nodes may not exist.
	
	- **Strongly Connected Components:**  
	  - These are maximal subgraphs in which every node is reachable from every other node via directed paths.

## My Personal Takeaways

1. Choosing the right graph representation is foundational—it shapes how effectively structural information is captured and utilized.
2. Deciding what constitutes the object of interest in graph construction can vary by application and is a non-trivial decision.
3. Familiarity with different representations (adjacency matrices vs. lists) and connectivity concepts is key to harnessing the full power of Graph ML.

- Next lecture on Node Embeddings will give a deeper understanding of how nodes are embedded based on structural and attribute similarities.
- Refer to the [Glossary](Glossary.html) for detailed definitions of key terms like node degree, connectivity, and graph types.
