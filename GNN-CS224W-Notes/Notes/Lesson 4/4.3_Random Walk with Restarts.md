## Discussion of Key Concepts

- **Proximity on Graphs:**  
    Beyond global importance, we often care about _proximity_—how close a node is to a given query node. Random walks measure this by the long-term probability of visiting nodes starting from the query.
    
- **Random Walk with Restarts (RWR):**  
    At each step:
    
    1. With probability 1–β, follow a random outgoing link according to the transition matrix M.
        
    2. With probability β, restart at the query node q.
        
    
    Here, teleportation goes only to q, focusing the stationary distribution around it.
    
- **Stationary Proximity Vector:**  
    The stationary vector r satisfies the linear equation:
    
    ```
    r = (1 - \beta) M r + \beta e_q
    ```
    
    where e_q is the one-hot vector for the query node. The value r_i reflects the proximity of node i to q.
    
- **Connections to PageRank:**
    
    - **PageRank:** teleport to any node uniformly:
        
        ```
        r = (1 - \beta) M r + \beta (1/N) * 1
        ```
        
    - **Personalized PageRank:** teleport to a seed distribution v:
        
        ```
        r = (1 - \beta) M r + \beta v
        ```
        
    - **RWR:** special case with v = e_q, teleporting only to the query.
        
- **Applications of RWR:**
    
    - Link prediction and recommendation by ranking proximity.
        
    - Community and anomaly detection around seed nodes.
        
    - Feature extraction: use r as local graph features for ML tasks.

## My Personal Takeaways (Geniali & Particolari)

1. **RWR as a Graph Microscope:**  
    Constant restarts focus exploration narrowly, uncovering micro-communities that global methods miss.
    
2. **Teleportation Encodes Bias:**  
    Restarting at q is like giving the walker memory, biasing paths without extra complexity.
    
3. **Unified Random-Walk Framework:**  
    PageRank, Personalized PR, and RWR differ only by teleport sets—one vector tweaks a single parameter, unlocking both global and local insights.

## Next Steps

- **Implement RWR:**  
    Iterate:
    
    ```
    r^(t+1) = (1 - \beta) M r^(t) + \beta e_q
    ```
    
    and plot how proximity scores evolve from q.
    
- **Test on Real Data:**  
    Run RWR on social or citation graphs, comparing top-k proximity to known labels or communities.
    
- **Compare with PPR:**  
    Vary teleport vector from e_q to multi-seed distributions; observe changes in spread and focus of r.
