## Discussion of Key Concepts

- **Power Iteration Method:**  
    To compute the PageRank vector , we use power iteration. Starting from any initial probability distribution , we repeatedly apply it until convergence. Each iteration involves one sparse matrix–vector multiplication plus a simple teleportation adjustment.
    
- **Convergence & Uniqueness:**  
    The Google matrix is constructed to be positive and column‑stochastic, ensuring a unique stationary distribution. Power iteration converges geometrically at a rate determined by the **spectral gap**, which is closely related to the damping factor.
    
- **Dead Ends & Spider Traps:**  
    Nodes with zero out‑degree (dead ends) and subgraphs with no outgoing edges (spider traps) cause probability mass to vanish or become trapped, breaking the Markov chain’s stochasticity and preventing meaningful global rankings.
    
- **Teleportation Fix:**  
    It has been introduced a damping factor (commonly set to 0.8–0.9) and define the Google matrix, where teleportation simultaneously solves both dead ends and spider traps by ensuring irreducibility and aperiodicity.
    
- **PageRank Equation:**      
    We compute this solution via power iteration rather than sampling random walks, trading  Monte Carlo variability for deterministic precision.
    
- **Damping Factor Choice:**  
    Empirically, setting balances following links and exploring new nodes, yielding robust rankings and reasonable convergence speeds.

## My Personal Takeaways

1. **Teleportation as Global Reset & Discovery:**  
    Teleportation not only prevents rank sinks but also injects a uniform exploration step, akin to hitting the “shuffle” button and discovering fresh parts of the graph.
    
2. **Spectral Gap as a Graph Health Indicator:**  
    The speed of convergence reveals graph cohesion: well connected, rapidly mixing networks converge quickly, while modular graphs with tight communities stall the iteration.
    
3. **Deterministic Precision over Stochastic Trials:**  
    By solving an eigenvector problem directly, we bypass the noise and variance of sampling random walks, gaining repeatable and exact rankings at the expense of relying on linear algebraic solvers.
